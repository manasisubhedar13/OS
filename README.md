# Operating System project

My operating systems project on multithreading, RMI and Multitasking concept.

This test case was created to test the program's functionality: “ClothStore.java” The first test case verifies the program's basic functionality using a single Client.

This testcase checks that it can call all the remote methods in the Server and that correct clothing data is maintained by the Server.

The test results show correct functionality.
